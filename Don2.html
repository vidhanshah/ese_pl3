      <article>Don 2 (also known as Don: The King Is Back) is a 2011 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film co-written, co-produced and directed by Farhan Akhtar. It is the second installment in the Don series. Jointly produced by Excel Entertainment and Red Chillies Entertainment, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Lara Dutta, Om Puri, Boman Irani and Kunal Kapoor. A sequel to the 2006 film Don (2006), Don 2 takes place five years after the previous film when titular character (Khan) plans to take over the European drug cartel. Meanwhile, Roma (Chopra) has joined the Interpol to hunt him down.

The film's music was composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, while Javed Akhtar wrote the lyrics. Jason West served as the film's cinematographer and Ritesh Soni was its editor. After the success of the first film, Akhtar had planned a sequel in 2010 which did not work out. It was then officially announced in early 2010, with filming scheduled to begin in later that year. Principal photography took place in Berlin, where it was shot extensively.

Don 2 was released on 23 December 2011 in 2D and 3D formats, which also included dubbed versions in Telugu and Tamil languages. The film had a mixed to positive reception from critics, receiving praise for the cast's performance, cinematography, production design and action sequences. However, its pace and music received criticism. With a box office gross of over ₹275.97 crore (US$39 million), Don 2 was a Big box office success. At the time of its release, the film was one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time and is the third highest-grossing Indian film of 2011. The film received a number of accolades across various ceremonies in India. The film received five nominations at the 57th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director for Akhtar and Best Actor for Khan, winning Best Sound Design and Best Action.</article>

      <article>Great movie seen in Bollywood as action, thrill, story line, direction, suspense all along. overall Power-packed performance by Shahrukh Khan. Truly the "KING IS BACK". People said that no-one could make a better Don than the man himself, Amitabh Bachchan. However, I would like to disagree. Shahrukh is the only actor of todays time that could ever make it better than the original. His style, charisma and witty remarks make it all the more appealing. Farhan Akhtar's superb directing made this film epic! There are no gaps, no over-the-top parts. As a director Farhan's best film ever. Film's background score is stunning. But the songs are not pretty good. The film's visual effects is better than MI-4, Ra.One, Robot, Krissh. It's stunning and well shot. The special effects add a special flavor to the film which makes it even more delicious. Each and every character in this film is perfect. But in some portion it remembers me Death Race2, specially in Jail. Anyway best movie of the year.</article>
